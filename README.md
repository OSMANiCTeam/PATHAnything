# PATHAnything
Add any (compatible) bash script to PATH

<b>IF YOU ARE TRYING TO ADD THIS SCRIPT TO PATH, CREATE A COPY OF IT, USE THE COPY TO ADD THIS SCRIPT TO PATH, THEN DELETE THE COPY. MOVING A RUNNING INSTANCE CAN CAUSE PROBLEMS AND ISSUES!!!</b>

Python scripts don't run!!! This script has no ability to add python scripts to PATH. Instead, create a bash script containing "python3 /home/your-username/your-python-script-name.py" and add that to PATH.
